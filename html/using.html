		<p>When you first start the QuickREx Application, it will look like in the screenshot below.
		The only open view is the QuickREx-View in the lower part of the application-window.</p>

		<img alt="The QuickREx contributions" src="images/quickREx_initial.png"/></img>
		
		<p>The QuickREx view is used to develop, test and use 
		regular expressions. Details on how the view is used can be found <a href="quickRExView.html">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The left hand side in the first screenshot holds the regular expression library in its default state. 
		The regular expression library is used to keep, organize, and search for regular expressions. 
		It is described in detail <a href="reLibView.html">here</a>. The editor area is used for the 
		regular-expression entry editor which is also described <a href="reLibView.html">here</a>.</p>
