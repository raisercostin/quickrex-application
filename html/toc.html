<h2>Why QuickREx?</h2>

<h3>For Testing Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Regular Expressions are powerful but
can be confusing at times. I regularly found myself working with scrapbook-pages to test my regular
expressions (or working late-night shifts to fix problems in production :-( ). QuickREx was written
to get around using scrapbook pages or working on the high-wire and to be able to play with regular expressions
more easily.</p>

<p>QuickREx is an Eclipse-based Application (also available as an Eclipse-plugin). 
QuickREx lets you enter test-texts and try regular expressions. The expressions are
evaluated against the test-text on the fly, matches are highlighted and you can navigate between the matches.
You can also navigate through groups within each match (if groups are defined in your regular expression).</p>

<p>QuickREx also offers TAB-completion for regular expressions. All TAB-completion suggestions as well as
the corresponding help-text popups are customizable. They are defined in .xml-files distributed with the
plug-in. These files can be changed to add additional hints, remove rarely used hints or change the descriptions.</p>

<p>QuickREx offers the most widely used implementations of Regular Expressions in the Java-world:</p>
<ul>
<li>JDK Regular Expressions (available since 1.4) - see <A href="http://java.sun.com" target="_blank">java.sun.com</A></li>
<li>Jakarta ORO Perl-style Regular Expressions (ORO-Version 2.0.8, supports Perl 5.003 Regular Expressions) - see <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html" target="_blank">jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html</A></li>
<li>Jakarta ORO Awk-style Regular Expressions (ORO-Version 2.0.8) - see <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html" target="_blank">jakarta.apache.org/oro/index.html</A></li>
<li>JRegex Regular Expressions (Version 1.2_01, supports Perl 5.6 Regular Expressions) - see <A href="http://jregex.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">jregex.sourceforge.net/</A></li>
<li>Jakarta-Regexp Regular Expressions (Version 1.4) - see <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html" target="_blank">jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html</A></li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the implementations, you can set the available compiler-flags through QuickREx or use
inline flag-switches with the regular expression.</p>

<p>See <A href="quickRExView.html#selectingImpl">here</A> for how to select an implementation.</p>

<p>Regular Expressions and Test-Texts can be persisted for later reference. Also, any file-contents can be loaded 
as test-text.</p>

<p>See <A href="quickRExView.html">here</A> for screen-shots and details on using the QuickREx-view.</p>

<h3>For Keeping and Organizing Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Another feature ist the Regular Expression Library. 
The Library it thought to be a tool to keep, organize, and search for regular expressions
which you may want to use again. There are a few selected expressions for things such as
checking date-formats, finding tags or searching for and matching lines in text containing 'FOO' and 'BAR'
(and maybe neither 'FAR' nor 'BOO'). You can add your own books with chapters holding regular expressions
useful to you.</p>

<p>The Regular Expression Library comes with an editor where you can enter the expression (with 
TAB-completion as you are used from QuickREx), enter a test-text and a description and also enter
a source (you may have found the expression in a book or on a web-page). Also, you can use the QuickREx-view
to test the expression against the saved test-text.</p>

<p>The Regular Expression Library is fully searchable, the entries are kept in XML-files (one for each book)
where the path's are at your choice (apart from the standard book wich is delivered with the plugin).</p>

<p>See <A href="reLibView.html">here</A> for screen-shots and details on using the library.</p>

<h3>For using Regular Expressions</h3>

<p>Another feature I am missing from time to time when working on Wintel-boxes is the good old 'grep' command.</p>

<p>QuickREx also offers this feature: Load your test-text, enter or load the 
regular expression you want and press the 'Grep'-button. QuickREx opens a dialog containing only the
matches separated by line-breaks.</p>

<p>This can be useful e.g. when you need to look at large log-files where you are only interested
in lines starting like 'ERROR'. (Of course, you could have used Log4j and adjusted the log-level in the
first place ;) )</p>

<p>See <A href="quickRExView.html#grepping">here</A> for details.</p>

<h2>Application versus Plug-In</h2>

<p>You are currently working with the application-version of QuickREx. Initially, QuickREx was designed
to be a plug-in module for the popular Eclipse-IDE. As people were interested in using QuickREx without
wanting to change their IDE to Eclipse, and since the Eclipse-platform knows the concept of stand-alone
applications, I decided to also offer QuickREx as a stand-alone application.</p>

<p>Code-wise, the application is only a thin wrapper around the plug-in, slightly changing the layout
and removing things which are not directly QuickREx-related. Under the hood, the QuickREx-plugin is
working, currently (Version 1.0.0 of the application) in Version 3.2.0. Also on this help-page you will
find the plug-in-documentation which holds some more details for those that are interested.</p>

<h2>What are the license terms?</h2>

<p>QuickREx (both the plug-in as well as the application) is distributed under the Eclipse Public License, v 1.0. You can find the license details
online at <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</A>.</p>

<p>The license is an Open Source license. The source can be found 
<A href="http://www.bastian-bergerhoff.com/eclipse/features/download/QuickREx/QuickRExApplicationsrc_1_0_0.zip">here</A>
as a zip-file for download.</p>

<p>I hope the application serves you well. In case you find any problems with using it, have ideas for additional useful features
or any other comments, <A href="mailto:info@bastian-bergerhoff.com?subject=QuickREx Application">contact me</a>.</p>
