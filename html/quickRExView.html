    <h2 name="QuickRExViewDetails">The QuickREx View</h2>

    <p>The QuickREx-View is the part of QuickREx in which you can design, test and apply
    regular expressions. It is displayed in the lower part of the application when you start
    QuickREx.</p>

    <p>The view looks as displayed in the screenshot below.</p>
    <img alt="The QuickREx View" src="images/QuickRExView.png"> 

    <p>The view is associated with the menu-entries in the menu "Evaluating". 
    The menu is displayed below.</p>
    <img alt="The QuickREx View-Menu" src="images/QuickRExViewMenu.png"/> 

		<a name="testing"><h3>Testing Regular Expressions</h3></a>

    <p>As you type text into the test-text area or a regular expression
    into the area for the regular expressions, the expression is
    constantly evaluated. The information on matches and groups is
    updated on the fly and matches are highlighted in the
    test-text.</p>

    <p>Below is a screenshot of a situation where there are no groups
    but several matches. The match highlighted in green is the current
    one. All information on groups pertains to the current match.</p>
    <img alt="The QuickREx View with matches" src="images/QuickREx2.png"/>

    <p>The information next to the buttons used to navigate between the
    matches is to be interpreted as "There are 7 matches altogether,
    the current match (highlighted in green) has a start-index of 2 and
    an end-index of 4". As you can see there are no groups in the
    current match. You can navigate between the matches using the
    'Previous' and 'Next' buttons near the label 'Matches'. If there
    were groups in the current match, you could navigate through the
    groups using the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons near the label
    'Groups'.</p>
    <img alt="The QuickREx View with matches which have groups" src="images/QuickREx3.png"/></img>

    <p>The above screenshot displays a case where there are groups in
    the current match. The current group is indicated by a bold font
    and the contents of the group are printed in the information-are
    next to the group-navigation buttons. The information there is to
    be interpreted as "There are 2 groups in the current match, the
    current group is the first one, containing 'This is a long test-text for '".</p>

		<a name="timeOutAndOfflineEvaluation"><h3>Time-out and offline evaluation</h3></a>

    <p>Evaluation of the regular expression can be done
    offline by unsetting the mark at <strong>'Live-evaluation'</strong> and using
    the <strong>'Evaluate'</strong>-button if evaluation is in order.</p>

    <p>Also, evaluation of the regular expression takes
    place in a separate thread and may be cancelled by the user or is automatically
    cancelled if it takes too long. The dialog for cancelling the evaluation appears
    with a small delay so that you will not notice it during fast live-evaluation.</p>

    <p>The time-out behaviour is configurable from the preference page available
    under <strong>'Help &gt; Preferences...'</strong> in the category 
    <strong>'QuickREx'</strong>. The preference page is displayed with the default settings
    in the screenshot below.</p>

		<a name="selectingImpl"><h3>Selecting the Reg-Exp implementation</h3></a>

    <p>QuickREx offers the most widely used implementations of
    Regular Expressions in the Java-world:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>JDK Regular Expressions (available since 1.4)</li>

      <li>Jakarta ORO Perl-style Regular Expressions (ORO-Version
      2.0.8, supports Perl 5.003 Regular Expressions)</li>

      <li>Jakarta ORO Awk-style Regular Expressions (ORO-Version
      2.0.8)</li>

      <li>JRegex Regular Expressions (Version 1.2_01, supports 
      Perl 5.6 Regular Expressions)</li>

      <li>Jakarta Regexp Regular Expressions (Version 1.4)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The default implementation is the JDK-one. To change the
    implementation, use the menu "Evaluating" (see
    screenshot above). The expression will immediatly be re-evaluated.
    Also, the TAB-completion will adjust to offer the completions
    defined for the selected implementation.</p>

    <a name="settingFlags"><h3>Setting global compiler-flags</h3></a>

    <p>You can set global compiler flags with any of the
    implementations QuickREx offers. This is done at the bottom of the
    view (see screenshot at the top of the page). To keep the view
    small, the "Global Flags"-section is folded away when the view is
    opened. To access it, click on the section-header.</p>

    <p>The state of the flags is saved when you close the view or leave
    the Workbench. Note that there are different flags depending on the
    chosen implementation. Also note that the flags do behave slightly
    differently, depending on the implementation chosen. Check the
    tool-tip texts for the check-boxes to find details about the
    individual flags (see screenshot).</p>

    src="images/QuickREx4.png"> 

    <a name="tabCompletion"><h3>Using TAB-completion</h3></a>

    <p>You can use
    TAB-completion for regular expressions in QuickREx. To get a list
    of proposals for completion of the current expression, hit
    'Ctrl+Space' while editing in the area for regular expressions. An
    assistant will open as displayed in the below screenshot. Scrolling
    through the suggestions also updates the hint on the right side of
    the proposal. When you select a proposal, QuickREx will try to work
    out whether the already typed in characters should be part of an
    expression or not.</p>
    <img alt="The code-completion assistant" src=
    "images/TABCompletion.png"> 

    <p>Note that due to the complexity of regular expressions,
    TAB-completion is not as accurate as it is e.g. in a Java-editor.
    Sometimes the proposed possibilities may result in illegal
    patterns. Generally, QuickREx tries to do a good job in guessing
    what you may want. To this end, the rules are roughly as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Offer all completions which are not definitely illegal. Thus
      for example, you will not be offered '+' ("Greedy match 1 or more
      times") at the beginning of the regular expression - but almost
      anything else.</li>

      <li>Try to guess the intentions of the user in cases where things
      are pretty clear. Offer things starting with the most likely
      ones. They are the exceptions, but there are cases where it is
      clear what the user is after. Thus, the input '\p{Lo' is very
      likely part of '\p{Lower}'. This will be the first offer.</li>

      <li>In case there are several potential completions even within
      the rules, offer the shortest ones first. Thus, if you start with
      '\' and ask for completion, you will be offered '\\', '\0', ...
      before \p{Lower}. If you keep typing and the next character typed
      is a 'p', you will notice how the order of proposals
      changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="grepping"><h3>Grep - extracting all matches from text</h3></a>

    <p>If you want to extract only the matches for a particular regular
    expression from the current test-text, simply select
    '<strong>Grep</strong>' in the menu "Evaluating" (see above). 
    A dialog as displayed below will open,
    holding all matches separated by line-feeds. You can copy the
    result from the dialog to the clipboard to use it anywhere else as
    usually.</p>
